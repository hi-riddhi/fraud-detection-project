#💳 Fraud Detection System 🕵️‍♀️

**Catching fraudsters one transaction at a time!**  
Turn every suspicious transaction into a solved mystery with the power of Machine Learning. 🚀

---

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Every single day, thousands of money transactions zip through digital pipelines. But hidden among these ordinary transfers are sneaky fraud attempts—a digital game of cat and mouse! 🐭😼

**This project builds a super-smart machine learning system that catches those trickster transactions before they can do any harm.**

- ✅ Perfect for Data Science Interns and job-seekers to show off real-world skills.
- ✅ Works on a giant, super-realistic dataset (~6.3 million rows!) for maximum wow factor.

## 📊 Dataset at a Glance

Ever wondered what bank systems see? Here’s a peek under the hood:

| **Feature**         | **What It Means**                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `step`              | Time step in hours (1 = first hour, 2 = second hour, ...) |
| `type`              | Transaction type: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, TRANSFER, etc.       |
| `amount`            | Transaction amount                                        |
| `oldbalanceOrg`     | Sender's balance before the transaction                   |
| `newbalanceOrig`    | Sender's balance after the transaction                    |
| `oldbalanceDest`    | Recipient's balance before the transaction                |
| `newbalanceDest`    | Recipient's balance after the transaction                 |
| `isFraud`           | 🚨 Target: 1 = fraud, 0 = legit                           |
| `isFlaggedFraud`    | Flag for illegal attempts (>200,000 units)                |

> ⚠️ **Class Imbalance Alert:** Only 0.17% of transactions are actually fraud. It's like finding a purple unicorn in a field of horses!

## 🛠️ How The Magic Happens (Our Secret Sauce)

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   🫧 Handle messy values, catch weird outliers, encode transaction types for machine eyes, and create smart features like `balanceDiff` to sharpen our fraud radar.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   🎨 Dive into data art: visualize patterns, trends, and those rare unicorn frauds. Spot that class imbalance as soon as possible!

3. **Model Building**
    - 🟢 **Logistic Regression:** The trusty classic.
    - 🌳 **Random Forest:** More trees, more power!
    - ✨ **XGBoost & LightGBM:** Fast, powerful, and perfect for catching the rarest trickery.
    - 💡 Tweak strategies: Use weighting and tuning to make rare frauds shout louder than the crowd.

4. **Evaluation & Explainability**
    - ✔️ **Metrics:** ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score — so we know what model actually works.
    - 📉 **Feature Importance:** Reveal what makes the model tick for transparency and trust.

## ⚡ Results: Who Caught the Most Fraudsters?

| **Model**               | **ROC-AUC** | **Precision** | **Recall** |
|-------------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Logistic Regression     |    0.92     |     12%       |    78%     |
| XGBoost                 |   0.991     |     89%       |    95%     |
| **LightGBM 🏅**          | **0.993**   |   **91%**     | **96%**    |

🥇 **LightGBM** takes the gold—ultra-light, super-fast, and crazy-accurate!
